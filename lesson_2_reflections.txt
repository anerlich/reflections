When you initialise a repository, Git creates a .git directory there which it 
will then use to track changes and commits. It does not perform a commit.

The staging area is where files are added before being committed. Once added to 
a staging area from the working directory, those files will then be tracked by
Git. Files can remain in the working directory untracked if not added to the
staging area.

The staging area can be used to take only the files related to the one logical
change about which you are concerned, which can then be committed as a block.

Branches are useful where you want to work on a different version of the 
program without affecting the main thrust of the original version.

Diagrams help visualise the branch structure by giving a visual indication of
each branch's history.

Automated merging handles the cases where there are no conflicts well, but
leaves you to resolve conflicts it finds.
