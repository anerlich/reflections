When you initialise a repository, Git creates a .git directory there which it 
will then use to track changes and commits. It does not perform a commit.

The staging area is where files are added before being committed. Once added to 
a staging area from the working directory, those files will then be tracked by
Git. Files can remain in the working directory untracked if not added to the
staging area.
