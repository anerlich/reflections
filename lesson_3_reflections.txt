When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

If I wish to collaborate with others or make my work available for others to 
look at and download. 
Also as a backup in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might want to track changes locally that I am not ready to commit to a public 
repository to be used or viewed by others.

A fork makes your personal copy of another repository, both on Github.

A clone makes a copy of a repository on your computer either from Github or 
another computer.

A branch is performed in a local repository to give an alternative development
path which may later be merged back in.
