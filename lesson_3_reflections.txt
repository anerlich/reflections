When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

If I wish to collaborate with others or make my work available for others to 
look at and download. 
Also as a backup in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might want to track changes locally that I am not ready to commit to a public 
repository to be used or viewed by others.
